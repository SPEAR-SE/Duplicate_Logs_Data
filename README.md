# Duplicate_Logs_Data


This is the repository containing the data for paper "Studying Duplicate Logging Statements and Their Relationships with Code Clones". We are still preparing for the data and will release more later.

- `LoggingStatement.zip` contains the logging statements with their related information extracted from the studied systems
- `DupLogs.zip` contains the lists of duplicate logging statements for each studied system
- `Instances.zip` contains the lists of duplicate logging code smells
